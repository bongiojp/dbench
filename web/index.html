<H2 align="center">Welcome to the DBENCH web pages</H2>

DBENCH is a tool to generate I/O workloads to either a filesystem or to a
networked NFS server. DBENCH can be used to stress a filesystem or a server
to see which workload it becomes saturated and can also be used for preditcion
analysis to determine "How many concurrent clients/applications performing
this workload can my server handle before response starts to lag?"

<p>DBENCH provides a similar benchmarking and client emulation that is
implemented in SMBTORTURE using the BENCH-NBENCH test for CIFS, but DBENCH
can play these loadfiles onto a local filesystem instead of to a CIFS server.
Using a different type of loadfiles DBENCH can also generate and measure
latency for NFS. </p>


<p>Features include:
<ul>
<li>Reading SMBTORTURE BENCH-NBENCH loadfiles and emulating this workload
as posix calls to a local filesystem
<li>NFS style loadfiles which allows DBENCH to mimic the i/o pattern of a real application doing real i/o to a real server.
</ul>

<h2>Loadfiles</h2>

<p>
At the heart of DBENCH is the concept of a "loadfile". A loadfile is
essentially a sequence of operations to be performed once statement at a time.
This could be operations such as "Open file XYZ", "Read 5 bytes from offset ABC", "Close the file", etc etc.
</p>

<p>
By carefully crafting a loadfile it is possible to describe an I/O pattern
that almost exactly matches what a particular application performs. While 
cumbersome to produce such a loadfile it does allow you to describe exactly
how/what an application performs and "replay" this sequence of operations
any time you want.
</p>

<p>
DBENCH loadfiles also contain a timestamp for each operation so that while
DBENCH is emulating the workload it also tries to keep the same rate of 
operations as the original application that we created the loadfile from.
This is very useful since this does allow to perform accurate scalability
predictions based on the exact application we are interested in and not an
artificial benchmark which may or may not be relevant to our particular
applications workload pattern.
