# example laodfile for SMB
# We do not distinguish between different status codes here so we basically
# treat the status code as a binary. It is either NT_STATUS_OK
# which means we expect the operation to succeed, or it is something
# else which means we expect it to fail.
#
# Filenames in SMB MUST start with '\' or '/'
#
#
# MKDIR
Mkdir "\foo" NT_STATUS_OK
#
# RMDIR
Rmdir "\foo" NT_STATUS_OK
